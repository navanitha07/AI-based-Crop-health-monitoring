#Description
🌾 AI-Based Crop Health Monitoring System
This repository uses the PlantVillage dataset (Resized 224×224 version) to build an AI-based crop health monitoring system. The dataset contains images of plant leaves categorized into healthy and diseased classes, enabling training and evaluation of deep learning models for plant disease detection.
